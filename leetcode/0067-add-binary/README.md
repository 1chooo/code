# [67. Add Binary](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-binary)


Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

### Example 1:

- Input: `a = "11", b = "1"`
- Output: `"100"`

### Example 2:

- Input: `a = "1010", b = "1011"`
- Output: `"10101"`
 

### Constraints:

- <code>1 <= a.length, b.length <= 10<sup>4</sup></code>
- `a` and `b` consist only of `'0'` or `'1'` characters.
- Each string does not contain leading zeros except for the zero itself.
